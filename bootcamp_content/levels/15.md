# Level 15

Welcome to Level 15, where we finally start putting all the pieces together. In the live session we look at (yet another!) way of positioning things, and how to animate with JavaScript.

Your exercises this week start getting you working with HTML, CSS and JS combined. There's a couple of tricky exercises, but break them into pieces and you'll get there!

Good luck!
